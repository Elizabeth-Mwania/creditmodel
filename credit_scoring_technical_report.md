# Credit Scoring Model Development: Technical Report
**Author**: Elizabeth Mwania  
**Date**: September 28, 2025  
**Project**: Victory Farms Credit Risk Assessment

## Executive Summary

This technical report documents the comprehensive development of a credit scoring model for Victory Farms, designed to assess credit risk for loan applications. The model development process followed industry best practices, incorporating transaction history analysis, behavioral patterns, and sophisticated machine learning techniques. The final Gradient Boosting model achieved an ROC-AUC of 0.85, demonstrating strong discriminatory power in identifying credit risk.

## 1. Data Overview and Preprocessing

### 1.1 Data Sources
The analysis utilized transactional and loan performance data containing:
- Customer identification (`customer_id`)
- Transaction details (`transaction_id`, `face_amount`, `transaction_date`)
- Loan performance metrics (`loan_repayment_rate`, `loan_repay_days`)
- Merchant information (`merchant_id`)

### 1.2 Target Definition
Credit risk classification was based on two key criteria:
- **Good (0)**: Loan repayment rate ≥ 100% AND repayment days ≤ 10
- **Bad (1)**: Loan repayment rate < 100% OR repayment days > 10

### 1.3 Data Quality
- Initial dataset size: ~100,000 transactions
- Time period: 6 months of historical data
- Missing value treatment: < 5% missing data
- Outlier handling: Statistical and domain-based approaches

## 2. Exploratory Analysis and Feature Engineering

### 2.1 Feature Categories

#### 2.1.1 Transaction Volume Features
- Transaction counts across time windows (7d, 1m, 3m, 6m)
- Average transactions per day
- Transaction growth metrics
- Transaction slope indicators

#### 2.1.2 Amount-Based Features
- Sum and average transaction amounts
- Amount variability measures
- Min-max ratios
- Z-score based features

#### 2.1.3 Activity Pattern Features
- Active days analysis
- Transaction density
- Volume recency indicators
- Inter-transaction intervals

### 2.2 Key Insights
1. Recent activity (1-3 months) shows stronger predictive power
2. Transaction consistency is more important than absolute amounts
3. Sudden changes in patterns indicate increased risk
4. Regular small transactions are better indicators than irregular large ones

## 3. Variable Binning and Transformation

### 3.1 Methodology
- Weight of Evidence (WOE) transformation
- Information Value (IV) analysis
- Optimal binning using decision trees
- Quality score validation

### 3.2 Key Transformations
1. **High IV Variables (IV > 0.3)**
   - Average daily transactions
   - Transaction density
   - Amount variability metrics

2. **Medium IV Variables (0.1 < IV < 0.3)**
   - Growth indicators
   - Pattern stability measures
   - Recency metrics

3. **Supporting Variables (IV < 0.1)**
   - Basic transaction metrics
   - Historical patterns
   - Absolute amounts
